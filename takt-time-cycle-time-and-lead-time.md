# Takt Time, Cycle Time, and Lead Time

### Takt Time

* Takt Time is the time between starting to work on one unit and starting the next. (Time to finish a product / service)&#x20;
* Cycle Time is the average time it takes to finish one unit.&#x20;
* Lead Time is the total time it takes from receiving an order to delivering an item.

Takt Time comes from German word which means "pulse", we use Take Time to measure customer's demand. Why we focus on Takt Time is use it to monitor whether we are overproduction or underproduction.

With a Take Time, we can:

1. Estimate service delivery processes
2. Maintain a constant production flow
3. Standardize work processes
4. Increase efficiency and decrease training times
5. Set realistic time targets
6. Minimize overtime

**Calculate Take Time**

$$
TaktTime=\frac{Net ProducitionTime}{Demand}
$$

### â€‹Cycle Time

Cycle Time is the time it takes to complete the production of one unit from start to finish.

**Question: Cycle Time and Takt Time, which should be greater?**

The answer is Take Time should be greater than Cycle Time. The reason behind this is because Cycle Time measures production, while Takt Time measures demand. Production should always be greater than demand in order to meet customer's need.

**Calculate Cycle Time**

$$
Cycle Time= \frac{NetProductionTime}{Capacity}
$$

### Lead Time

Lead Time is the time it takes for one unit to go through the entire production cycle, from taking the order to payment receipt.&#x20;

If Lead Time is much higher than Cycle Time, it means you have a lot of units in your inventory.
