# Job, Career, and Life Principles of Mine

**Brief introduction:** I am a postgrad at the [Texas A\&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) in [Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/index.html), and I am currently working as a full-time continuous improvement intern at [Volvo Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/volvo-group/).

I put down some principles I (try to) follow on my job search, career development, and life exploration principles here, they are not in particular order.

* Job searching is not really about job searching. It is more about self-understanding, growing as a person, contributing to a team that I admire, and doing things that I respect.
* What feels like a big problem to us today is likely not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, it is hard to judge progress over short intervals, zooming out often puts things in perspective, ups and downs are an integral part of this life.
* Align day-to-day actions with long-term values and goals no matter where I go and what I do.
* It's not (all) about money. Do the right thing with the right people and the money will come. I can't imagine a different way of living.
* Go all-in on whatever I do.
* Sincerity matters and actions speak loudly than words.
* I prefer feedback over nicety. If there are things you can tell me to make me better, please tell me so. Improvement is always the better choice in the long run.
